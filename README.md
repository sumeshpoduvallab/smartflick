Have you ever had to answer “What movie should I watch next?” question at least once when you came home from work? The need to build robust movie recommendation systems is extremely important given the huge demand for personalized content of modern consumers. Popular streaming service like Netflix estimate the likelihood that you will watch a particular title in our catalog based on a number of factors including: (a) your interactions with our service (such as your viewing history and how you rated other titles) (b) other members with similar tastes and preferences on our service, and (c) information about the titles, such as their genre, categories, actors, release year, etc. SmartFlick should recommend movies to viewer based on their past likings. SmartFlick will find similar movies to a given movie and then recommend those similar movies to the viewer.
